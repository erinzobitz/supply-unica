There&rsquo;s an inner well out of which the work finds form. These vessels act as a metaphor for an individual life, and the freedom I believe all people should have to become the best and most sincere versions of themselves. The process of becoming involves personal growth, willingness to change, openness to accepting where we&rsquo;ve messed up, and the willingness to get up and try again. Failure is a good teacher precisely because it hurts our pride in its occurrence. We strive for some \"thing,\" and then it doesn't work out, or we fuck it up because we're not paying attention. And yet, oddly, if we can accept that failure is not an objectively true thing about who we are, but rather a way of seeing where we need to change, it's the beginning of the new. It is the beginning of improvisation, experimentation, and wonder.<\/p>\n<p>I want this work to inspire people to believe that they can go and do and be in a new way. The status quo should not be the thing that drives our lives. We live in crazy times. There is so much we're all taking in every day, and it's difficult to remember that information is not the same thing as truth. What is truth? You are truth. You exist and you have a soul and a life that is calling you to engage, and many of us are wasting our precious time on this earth arguing with each other and pursuing vane things that will not last. My work is about expressing the truth I've experienced over the past several years of realizing fear is personal and it's the reason so many of us do not jump fully in-to the process of becoming who we truly feel we are on the inside.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The world will change for the better when individuals start the difficult and challenging work of bringing forth what is within them. We must learn, both as individuals and as a species how to re-amalgamate the previous pain we've experienced as a collective and a whole into something new and vibrant, from out of this world, not only for ourselves, but for the betterment of the lives of people we will never meet. To do this, one must be willing to forge their own path, and that takes real intent and lots of hard work for a long time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It's uncomfortable and painful to forge your own path in this life. It&rsquo;s a day in, day out process of learning to exist in a wilderness that is life. When you're in it, doing the work, it's a more real than you'd prefer. But this is the task, the real work. Most of the people on that stage have a right to be there. They did the work. And even then, there was never a guaranty. It's a risk to go after your dreams, and in that process, you will be challenged. Your insecurities and hurts will be triggered, but you can learn that these things do not have to define you. Your past may have been fucked up, but it does not have to be your future, and your future starts today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You gotta start and show up. These past several years have been the most challenging of my adult life, but they are also some of the most fulfilling years because I'm living out of the center of my true self. This is beyond dualistic description. It is the asymmetrical wonder that is the experience of coming to know yourself more fully from within. No one can take that from you.<\/p>\n<p>These challenges show you what you&rsquo;re made of and what you&rsquo;re not, for better and for worse. But you can get up&nbsp;tomorrow&nbsp;and try again. Your challenges are your reward. Your pain will become your wisdom. When you show up in the midst of the chaos and do your best work, even though you may stumble through it, then and only then will you find your deeper strength. It is strenuous, though the fruit is that you'll experience you're own blooming faith in yourself, and in life itself. The universe has conspired in favor of your making. Call it by whatever you like, it changes not a damn thing that Time is precious. You could die&nbsp;tomorrow. So you must get to work today. Follow Your Heart Now.

I studied glassblowing at Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, the program was also very sculpture focused and many of my pieces combined different materials, though I didn't do much in clay at that time. A year or so after graduating I moved to Philadelphia and got a job working at a fine arts bronze casting foundry and worked there for the next 9 years. I was able to cast my own sculptures there and started making more work in bronze, combining that with glass and getting more into glass kiln casting at the time. I mostly worked in the wax department and realized I enjoyed that part of the casting process the most - more so than metal working etc, I liked the more hands on-ness of sculpting with the material.<\/p>\n<p>Then I started exploring making jewelry and naturally started to think about combining the bronze with other materials like clay since I really like the juxtaposition of contrasting materials, i.e. smooth shiny metal with the sandy, earthy textures of some clays. At that point, I thought about how I could translate some of my glass and bronze sculptures into ceramic or at least add some elements of ceramic into them. I tend to have many ideas at once and since metal casting can be a long process, it typically took me a long time to complete a single sculpture and I wanted a material that was more immediate - although I should say that working in ceramics is by no means a quick process! That being said, it can require equipment that is less complicated to set up and frees up the dependency from someone else's facilities and being able to be more independent in that way appealed to me.<\/p>\n<p>I then attended a ceramic hand-building class that a local artist was offering at her studio&nbsp;which enabled me to explore some of my ideas, from there I was hooked on clay. I loved the process of working with my hands on the material, the (relative)immediacy of the results and the endless possibilities of what you can do with and how you can get the clay to look like. I began to learn more about clay on my own in my studio, bringing my pieces to be fired at local places with cooperative kilns or friends' kilns until I was finally able to get my own.<\/p>","custom-width":"100%","custom-alignment":"center","custom-align_text":"left"}},"1518028947525":{"type":"text","settings":{"custom-title":"Where do you find your inspiration?","custom-text":"<p>Inspiration comes from many places for me.

I look to artists and art movements of the past, architecture and geometry. Somewhere in my head that's all swirling around but for me, drawing specifically from any one source has not been my approach and mostly I come up with new forms and designs from exploring a shape, patterns or color combinations and experimenting or meditating on those ideas, while also being open to let the clay and process guide the results.<\/p>\n<p>It's in that mind space that something will just click and I'll get this feeling that an idea is either working or not, and I&rsquo;ve learned to follow that intuition.
